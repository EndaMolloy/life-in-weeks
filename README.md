# life-in-weeks

Visual display of the finatude of life. Each red/white LED is a week, with red LEDs representing weeks that have already lapsed. Weeks are displayed on the x-axis with years on the y-axis. The yellow LEDs denote decade years. The number years displayed assumes I reach the rype old age of 90 (heres hoping) and as its a 64x64 matrix the first year shown is my early 20s. A second matrix in series could be used to capture all years.

The project is based on the blog post by Tim Urban ([https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html))

Spend time with the people you love and be kind.
